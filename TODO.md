# TODO
## Testing
- Assert that all environment variables are present on all pods
- Check if annotations can be set
- Make sure secrets are passed on
- Check whether labels and annotations can be passed on to `DaskCluster` subresource from `DaskJob`

## Configuration:
- If secret annotations should be passed on to workers and scheduler? 

## Docs:
- Default image will be used when none is given
- Additional worker groups are not supported yet, as those would require submitting two CRs
- Autoscaler won't work as this would require submitting an additional CR
- If limits are set, `--nthreads` and `--memory-limit` are set
â€“ https://kubernetes.dask.org/en/latest/kubecluster.html?highlight=--nthreads#best-practices
- Recommended to set limits! 

## Questions to Dan: 
- Are there integration or e2e tests?
- Documentation does not show up? 
- Re-locking deps for docs and package on Linux
- How to deal with interruptable nodes? At the moment no way to make scheduler and runner non-interruptable
- Setting namespace won't work, overridden by plugin manager
